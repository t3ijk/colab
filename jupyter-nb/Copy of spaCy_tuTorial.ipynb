Typically, there are contracts (sales contracts, work agreements, partnerships), there are invoices, there are insurance policies, there are regulations and other laws, and so on.\n","All of those are represented as text.\n","\n","You may run across a few acronyms: _natural language processing_ (NLP), _natural language understanding_ (NLU), _natural language generation_ (NLG) — which are roughly speaking \"read text\", \"understand meaning\", \"write text\" respectively.\n","Increasingly these tasks overlap and it becomes difficult to categorize any given feature.\n","\n","The _spaCy_ framework — along with a wide and growing range of plug-ins and other integrations — provides features for a wide range of natural language tasks.\n","It's become one of the most widely used natural language libraries in Python for industry use cases, and has quite a large community — and with that, much support for commercialization of research advances as this area continues to evolve rapidly."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7fxLSjSFsq9k"},"source":["## Getting Started\n","\n","Check out the excellent _spaCy_ [installation notes](https://spacy.io/usage) for a \"configurator\" which generates installation commands based on which platforms and natural languages you need to support.\n","\n","Some people tend to use `pip` while others use `conda`, and there are instructions for both.
